# Regression of Used Car Prices (Kaggle)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **used car prices** using regression techniques based on a Kaggle dataset.  
The goal is to build an **end-to-end applied machine learning pipeline**, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

This project is designed to demonstrate **practical data science skills** rather than purely theoretical modeling.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Used Car Prices Dataset  
- Observations: Used car listings with technical, categorical, and usage-related features  
- Target variable: `price`

Typical features include:
- Vehicle age
- Mileage
- Brand / model
- Engine specifications
- Fuel type
- Transmission

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of numerical variables  
- Correlation analysis
- Detection of outliers and skewed features

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (where applicable)
- Train / validation split

### 3. Modeling
Regression models applied:
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Regularized models (Ridge / Lasso)
- Tree-based models (Random forest/ XGBoost)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metric: **RMSE** **R2**
- Comparison between baseline and improved models
- Overfitting / underfitting checks

---

## 📈 Results
- The final model significantly outperforms the baseline regression.
- Key drivers of used car prices include:
  - Vehicle age
  - Mileage
  - Brand
  - Engine power

(Exact metrics and visualizations are shown in the notebook.)
